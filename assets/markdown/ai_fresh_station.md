### **The Problem**

Many city dwellers lack access to fresh vegetables and greenery. While some aspire to grow their own food, urban life presents significant challengesâ€”limited space, lack of natural sunlight, and the need for constant plant care. 

This has led to the rise of home gardening devices that use artificial sunlight and automated irrigation to enable indoor cultivation.

However, most existing solutions suffer from inefficiencies: they take up too much space, do not yield enough for daily consumption, and lack scalability for semi-industrial use.

### **The Solution: AI Fresh Station**
My friend, **[Oleh Bielous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleh-bielous/)**, saw an opportunity to create a better solution. His concept revolved around **modular, space-efficient, and AI-powered indoor gardening**.

 Unlike conventional devices, his design introduced a **stackable system** composed of **individual pots**, each with **independent irrigation control**. This unique approach allowed for:

- **Vertical stacking** for high-yield growth in limited spaces, making it suitable not just for homes but also for restaurants and urban farms.
- **Precise irrigation control** for each pot, enabling staggered growth cycles. By adjusting watering schedules, plants could grow in smooth "waves," ensuring a continuous supply of fresh produce.
- **AI-powered plant health monitoring**, with an integrated **camera system** to analyze plant conditions and detect early signs of disease or stress.

### **My Role in the Project**
I was responsible for developing the **mobile app** that served as a **remote control** for the system, allowing users to monitor and manage their crops seamlessly. Additionally, I built the **server infrastructure** that connected the app to the gardening device, ensuring real-time data exchange and control.
From the app user could schedule plant growing, control the device(like turning off the light) and monitor the plants. Since we wanted our app to work on both iOS and Android I had to switch from Android to **Flutter** and learn it in the matter of weeks, and since I never worked on backend prior this project I also had to learn **Python, Flask, MySQL**.

### **Recognition and Impact**
We showcased AI Fresh Station at multiple **engineering exhibitions**, receiving **several awards** for its innovation and practical application. The project demonstrated the potential of smart agriculture in urban environments, bridging the gap between technology and sustainable food production.

This project won silver medal at iCan 2020, a silver medal at Warsaw Invention Show, a gold medal at INTARG Poland, Silver medal at iCan
